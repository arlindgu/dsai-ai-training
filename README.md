# Schwarzgeld Detection â€“ Data Science Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a school data science project focused on detecting potential money laundering ("Schwarzgeld") using AI-based methods.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze financial transaction data and develop a machine learning model capable of flagging suspicious patterns indicative of illicit funds.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and evaluation of classification models
- Analysis of model accuracy and false positive rates
- Visualizations and result interpretation

## Tech Stack

- **Python** for scripting and model development
- **pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for documentation and analysis
